There are two unit test targets in this project, and also an associated test shell application target.

Logic Tests
-----------

The KSHTMLWriterTests target consists of logic tests, and has no UI dependencies. 

To run these, select the KSHTMLWriter scheme in Xcode, and choose "Test" from the "Product" menu.


Application Tests
-----------------

The KSHTMLWriterWebkitTestShellTests target consists of tests that use the Webkit framework. 

The Webkit tests need to run in the context of an application with a UI. This is the KSHTMLWriterWebkitTestShell target.

To run these tests, select the KSHTMLWriteWebkitTestShell scheme in Xcode, and choose "Test" from the "Product" menu.
